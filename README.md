### 2. Why are there no instructions on the initial 42 logic tests?

> The reason is to motivate participants to think and solve problem by themselve.

#

### 3. What are the core 42 principles?

> I think core principle of this school is the concept of "piscine", it's like You were droped off into the middle of the ocean and you have to find the way to swim back to the shore. However, you are not alone, there are people who is in the same situation like you and if you help each other, you will accomplish your goal faster . There will be time when you fail and feeling like you want to give up. But you are not alone, you have friends who will fail like you, learn from it and grow together.

#

### 6. What do you think you’re learning the most at 42?

> I learn that when you got stuck at some problem for a while, you should to reach out to your peers and ask for help. You may be able to grow strong by yourself, but when you have friends to help on each other, you will grow faster and maybe even stronger.

#

### 7. Imagine (this will happen very soon in real life!), you’ve been stuck on the problem for a while and have no idea what to do - what your next steps would be?

> Asking for help from your peers. You may be able to grow strong by yourself, but when you have friends to help on each other, you will grow faster and maybe even stronger.

#

### 8. How will you ensure that your personal level of motivation remains high on a daily basis to complete at least 1 level per month without the Piscine pressure and strict dead- lines?

> I believe that the effective way to stay motivated is to keep intouch with your peers so we can learn from each other and share experience together, this way you will stay alert and keep learning new things so you can share your knowledge with your friends.

# V.4 Life after 42

### 9. If someone asks you why it says internships are required on the 42 website, but they do not offer job placement, what would you say?

> Maybe 42 want us to have working experience before we have to apply for a programming job because most of the company prefer someone who already have an experience to do the job. I think the reason 42 do not offer job placement is relate to their school concept, you mostly have to doing things by yourself. However, I beleive that being student of 42 will teach you how to work as a team, developing programming skills and other skills which required for an internship so it's not going to be hard for you to find place to do an internship.

### 10. How do the internships work? Is it mandatory that you have to reach a certain level before leaving on an internship or can you validate it anytime you find one?

> As far as i know, the information is from github of 42 student, you have to reach level 7 before doing internship program. I think the reason that you have to reach a certain level before leaving on an internship program is to prepare your skills (both soft and hard skills) before you have an internship program.

### 11. How does 42 help you adapt to a work place?

> I think that with 42 system , peer to peer and project base learning, which teach me how to work as a team, how to help each other to accomplish the same goal, and accept the diversity of people etc. will make me ready to adapt to new work place.
